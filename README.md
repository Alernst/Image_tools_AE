<h1>Zebrafish Image Tools <br> for ImageJ, QuPath, Matlab and Jupyter notebooks</h1>
<h3><i>by Alexander Ernst and the lab of Nadia Mercader</i></h3>
On this page you will find a set of processing and analysis tools that were created for the handling of different types of images from zebrafish samples. There are comments within the code to explain the different step and additional text documents with a detailed explanation. The tools are sorted into categories based on the type of sample. Some example images can be found together with the tools.
